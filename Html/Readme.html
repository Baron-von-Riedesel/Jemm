 1. About Jemm

 Jemm is an "Expanded Memory Manager" (EMM), based on the source of FreeDOS
 Emm386. It should work with MS-DOS and compatible DOSes, including FreeDOS.
 Like other EMMs it installs the following services:

 - uses extended memory to simulate expanded memory (EMS) according to 
   EMS v3.2 and EMS v4.0.
 - upper memory blocks (UMB) where drivers and resident programs may
   be loaded, thus increasing available free DOS memory.
 - mapping RAM to the video address segments A000-AFFF and B000-B7FF.
 - VCPI services to allow DOS applications running in V86-mode to
   switch to protected mode. VCPI also implements a simple memory management.
 - VDS API to give drivers/applications some control over DMA and physical
   addresses in V86-mode.

 There exist 2 versions of Jemm:

 - Jemm386: standard version which needs an external eXtended Memory Manager
            (XMM; examples: Himem[S]X, MS Himem, XMGR ) to be loaded.
 - JemmEx:  extended version which has an XMM already included.

 JemmEx most likely is the better choice because it will need less DOS
 memory than an external XMM + Jemm386.


 2. Features

 The main purpose of making Jemm was to make it use less resources than
 other EMMs, without making compromises regarding speed or compatibility.
 The results currently are:

 - Jemm386 needs just 128 bytes DOS upper memory. JemmEx uses more, mostly
   because it includes the XMS handle array which is located in DOS memory.
   With 32 XMS handles JemmEx needs 496 bytes DOS memory.
 - Jemm's extended memory usage is:
   + 44 kB for Jemm itself
   + 64 kB for the DMA buffer (default size)
   + xx kB for UMBs mapped in the first MB
   +  4 kB fixed amount for EMS handle management.
   + xx kB variable amount for EMS/VCPI memory management. For each 1.5 MB
        VCPI memory 64 bytes are needed, for each EMS page 5 bytes are needed.
        For the default values (120 MB VCPI, 2048 EMS pages) this is 16 kB.
 - VCPI shared address space in extended memory is just 4 kB.

 Other features are:

 - Jemm can be loaded and unloaded from the command line. Disadvantage:
   DOS won't care about UMBs supplied this way.
 - CPUs which provide the Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions (Pentium+) are
   actively supported, which increases the emulation speed.
 - the FASTBOOT option shortens reboot time.
 - the SPLIT option can gain additional DOS high memory.
 - Exceptions in protected-mode are detected and displayed.
 - a (rudimentary) API is supplied which allows to extend Jemm. [ JLoad
   uses this API to add support for 32bit protected-mode extensions (JLMs). ]
 - JemmEx supports XMS v3.5, allowing access to extended memory beyond the
   4 GB barrier. See XMS35.txt for technical details.


 3. Commandline Options

 For a list of available options enter:

 JEMM386/JEMMEX -?

 Option     Comment
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 A20/NOA20  will set the A20 enable/disable emulation accordingly.
 ALTBOOT    this option is meant to select an alternate reboot handler,
            if the standard handler doesn't work. The current implementation
            sends a "system reset" command to the keyboard controller.
 B=xxxx     specify lowest segment address for EMS banking (default=4000,
            min=1000).
 D=nnn      this option will set the size of the DMA buffer to &lt;nnn&gt; kB.
            The default size is 64 kB, max size is 128 kB. Will always be
            rounded up to next 4 kB.
 EMX        option to prevent EMX DOS extender from quickly terminating with
            message "out of memory (RM)" on machines with large amounts
            of RAM (&gt; 256 MB). This is optionally because it makes Jemm
            behave not fully VCPI compliant, but shouldn't hurt usually.
 FASTBOOT   option might allow a fast reboot. There is no guarantee that it
            will work, though, see the "Option FASTBOOT" chapter below.
 FRAME=nnn  instructs Jemm to use a certain page frame. Accepted are frame
            values from 8000 to E000 or NONE. The page frame should start
            at the beginning of a physical EMS page, that is, the frame 
            address should be divisible by 0x400 without remainder. FRAME=NONE
            disables the page frame, but there are quite some programs which
            won't run with this setting. A page frame below A000 should 
            be set only on computers with 512 kB of conventional memory.
            Usually it's better to let Jemm find a page frame on its own, 
            because choosing an address which is not free might cause troubles.
 I=mmmm-nnnn force Jemm to use a memory range for UMBs (or page frame).
            &lt;mmmm&gt; must be &gt;= A000. Specifying a range which is not
            really free may give "unexpected" results.
 I=TEST     scan ROMs for unused address space. This option will regard any
            4 kB page containing identical byte values in read-only memory as
            "unused".
 LOAD       installs Jemm from the command line. Be aware that UMBs
            cannot be provided this way, since DOS will ignore them.
 [MAX=]nnn  limit the maximum amount of memory to be allocated for VCPI (and
            EMS, if &lt;nnn&gt; is below 32 MB). The MAX= prefix is optional (a
            number found as option will be handled as if it has a MAX=
            prefix). Default value is 120 MB.
 MIN=nnn    preallocates &lt;nnn&gt; kB of XMS memory thus making sure this
            memory is truly available for EMS/VCPI. If MIN is higher than
            MAX, MAX will be adjusted accordingly. Default for &lt;nnn&gt; is 0.
 MOVEXBDA   move XBDA into UMB, thus increasing low DOS memory. This option
            may cause a system "lock" because the XBDA might contain buffers
            used for DMA operations. In such cases either use MOVEXBDA.EXE or
            UMBPCI+UMBM instead.
 NOCHECK    disallows access via Int 15h, AH=87h to address regions which
            aren't backuped by RAM. As for Jemm386: be aware that some old 
            XMMs return wrong values for highest physical RAM - then this 
            option may cause strange results. Also, this option may prevent
            real-mode programs from using the VESA LFB.
 NODYN      disables XMS dynamic memory allocation. Jemm will allocate
            XMS memory for EMS/VCPI on initialization. Default is size
            of largest XMS block/2, but max. 32MB. With option MIN=xxx one
            may override this.
 NOEMS      disables EMS support.
 NOHI       this option will prevent Jemm from moving its resident part
            into upper memory. If no UMBs are installed by Jemm, NOHI
            has no effect.
 NOINVLPG   disables usage of INVLPG opcode on 80486+ cpus. Might be useful
            if Jemm runs in a virtual environment (see "Troubleshooting").
 NOVCPI     disables VCPI. Option can be set from the command line.
 NOVMW      disables VMWare detection.
 PGE/NOPGE  options will enable/disable the Page Global Enable feature
            on Pentium Pro+ cpus. This allows to mark all PTEs for the
            real-mode address space 0-110000h as "global", which gives
            a slight speed benefit for VCPI applications. Option is off by
            default because some DOS extenders will not work with PGE
            enabled. Also setting both PGE + NOINVLPG will not work.
 RAM/NORAM  will instruct Jemm to supply UMBs or not. RAM is the default.
            NORAM is intended to be used when loading Jemm from the
            cmdline, in which case adding UMBs might be less useful.
 S=mmmm-nnnn add a memory region (which must be in range C800-EFFF) as UMB.
            The memory region has to be filled with Shadow-RAM activated by
            UMBPCI, which must have been loaded *before* Himem/JemmEx.
            NOTE: since v5.80, this option is virtually obsolete, because
            either Jemm should find RAM activated by UMBPCI automatically, or,
            if UMBM.EXE has been loaded in CONFIG.SYS, the RAM is already used
            by DOS.
 SB         Soundblaster driver compatibility mode on.
 SPLIT      if ROMs are found which don't end exactly at a 4 kB boundary
            then setting this option will increase available UMB space. ROM
            sizes are defined in 0.5 kB units, so there might be up to 3.5 kB
            wasted in the ROM's last 4 kB page. There is a small catch: the
            full 4k page will be made writeable, including the ROM part.
 UNLOAD     uninstalls Jemm from the command line. Uninstalling the EMM
            might confuse resident programs which rely on EMS or VCPI but
            didn't ensure this configuration to keep unchanged (by allocating
            an EMS page) while they are running.
 V86EXC0D   makes Jemm route General Protection Faults (GPF) that occur in
            V86-mode to Int 0Dh. Without this option they are routed to
            Int 06h. This option should only be set if a resident program
            is to be installed that can handle GPFs in V86-mode.
 VCPI       (re)enables VCPI. Option can be set from the command line.
 VERBOSE    talk a bit more during the load process (abbreviation: /V).
 VME/NOVME  options will enable/disable using the V86 Mode Extensions
            on Pentium+ CPUs. These options can be set from the command line.
            NOVME is the default.
 X=mmmm-nnnn exclude a memory range to be used as UMBs or page frame.
            &lt;mmmm&gt; must be &gt;= A000.
 X=TEST     will exclude all upper memory regions which contain byte values
            other than 00 or FF.

 JemmEx additionally understands:

 A20METHOD:x   select A20 switch method.
               Possible values for &lt;x&gt;:
               ALWAYSON    Assume that A20 line is permanently ON
               BIOS        Use BIOS to toggle the A20 line
               FAST        Use port 92h, bypass INT 15h test
               PS2         Use port 92h, bypass PS/2 test
               KBC         Use the keyboard controller
               PORT92      Use port 92h always
 HMAMIN=k      set minimum amount in kB to get the HMA (default=0, max=63).
 MAXEXT=l      limit extended memory controlled by XMM to &lt;l&gt; kB.
 MAXSEXT=l     limit extended memory beyond 4GB barrier ("super-extended") to
               &lt;l&gt; kB; setting MAXSEXT=0 will make JemmEx behave like a
               v3.0 XMM.
 NOE801        don't use int 15h, ax=E801h to get amount of extended memory.
 NOE820        don't use int 15h, ax=E820h to get amount of extended memory;
               option is ignored unless MAXSEXT=0 is set.
 X2MAX=m       limit for free extended memory in kB reported by XMS V2 
               (default 65535). It is reported that some old applications
               need a value of &lt;m&gt;=32767.
 XMSHANDLES=n  set number of XMS handles (default=48, min=10, max=128).


 4. Technical Details

 4.1 EMS Implementation Notes

 - The number of EMS pages is limited to 2048 (= 32 MB). It can be increased
   up to 32768 pages (= 512 MB) by setting MIN=&lt;nnn&gt; to a value higher than
   32 MB. However, this memory will then be preallocated, and not be available
   as XMS memory. Some applications will not work if EMS &gt; 32 MB.

 - There is one memory pool, which is shared by EMS and VCPI.

 - The following EMS 4.0 functions aren't implemented. Calling these
   functions will return error code 84h in register AH:

   + Int 67h, AH=5Ch, prepare expanded memory manager hardware for warm boot
   + Int 67h, AH=5Dh, enable/disable OS/E


 4.2 Emulation of privileged Opcodes

 To provide Expanded Memory an EMM Emulator like Jemm runs the cpu in
 so-called V86-mode. This mode does not allow to run privileged opcodes.
 Some of these opcodes which might be useful for application programs
 are emulated by Jemm. These are:

 - mov &lt;special_reg&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;   ;special_reg = CRn, DRn, TRn
 - mov &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;special_reg&gt;   ;reg = eax, ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebp
 - WBINVD
 - INVD
 - WRMSR
 - RDMSR
 - RDTSC

 Those instructions may generate an exception 0x0D if they occur in V86-mode
 ( for RDTSC, this depends on a bit in register CR4 ). Jemm's exception handler
 examines the opcode causing the exception and - if the instruction is to be
 "emulated" - runs it in ring 0.


 4.3 IOPL Sensitive Instructions

 Jemm runs V86-mode code with IOPL 3. That means, the instructions that are
 sensitive to IOPL in V86-mode - CLI, STI, PUSHF, POPF, INT xx, IRET - will
 run at full speed, without causing a GPF.


 4.4 VMWare Detection

 As default, Jemm tries to detect if it's running under VMWare. This is done
 by reading port 0x5658 with value "VMXh" in register EAX. If the detection
 is successful, Jemm assumes that address range E8000-EFFFF is not to be used.
 However, range E8000-EBFFF may still be included with the "I=" option.

 The VMWare detection can be disabled with option NOVMW.


 4.5 Option FASTBOOT

 The FASTBOOT option may work with many versions of DOS. However, there are
 quite a few restrictions. To speed up the boot process, FASTBOOT tries to
 avoid resetting the system. This implicates that the interrupt vector table
 and at least the disk devices can be reset to the state before DOS has been
 loaded. Resetting the interrupt vector table requires some cooperation from
 DOS. Other things that may get in the way are:

 - Moving the XBDA into an UMB with option MOVEXBDA is critical, because to
   move it back into conventional memory might not work for various reasons.

 - older FreeDOS versions may need JEMFBHLP.EXE to be installed prior to the
   XMM (Himem). Possibly this might also be needed for MS-DOS versions &lt; 5.

 - UMBPCI allows to activate "Shadow RAM", but there's no option to deactivate
   it. This may confuse Jemm, since it can only detect RAM activated by UMBPCI
   if UMBPCI's signature is found.

 - A boot loader (Grub) might have inserted code in conventional memory to
   modify hard disks numbers. There's no guarantee that this code survives the 
   fastboot process.


 4.6 Option MAXSEXT

 JemmEx only: this option limits amount of "super-extended" memory. Setting
 MAXSEXT=0 disables this feature. If enabled, JemmEx must exclusively manage
 this type of memory, To achieve this, interrupt 15h, AX=0xE820 is hooked and
 any memory region beyond 4 GB that's marked as available is changed to
 "reserved" ( tool MEMSTAT may be used to verify this behavior ).


 4.7 Option NOEMS

 Despite its name, this option does not fully disable EMS. What's done is:

 - device name changed from EMMXXXX0 to EMMQXXX0
 - no page frame installed
 - EMS memory pool is limited to 8 MB

 The change of the device name makes the usual EMM detection routines fail.
 OTOH, the interrupt 67h API is fully functional. Most of this is pretty
 similar to what "recent" MS Emm386 versions do - the only difference is
 that they won't limit the memory pool to 8 MB, but install it in its full
 size (32 MB).


 4.8 Option SB

 Option SB was supposed to help Creative's SoundBlaster emulation drivers for
 SB PCI devices. It translates an exception 0Dh with error code 0x1A that
 may have occured in V86 mode to an INT 3. That's rather obscure and most
 likely was just a misunderstanding.


 5. Compatibility

 Jemm is NOT an MS Emm386 clone. Differences are:
<UL> 
<LI> - obviously commandline options differ.
</LI>
<LI> - the device driver API, accessed by opening file "EMMXXXX0" and
   then issueing IOCTL cmds, differs.
</LI>
<LI> - Jemm doesn't support the so-called GEMMIS API.
</LI>
<LI> - Jemm doesn't support the IO port trapping API of MS Emm386.
</LI>
<LI> - Jemm supports UMBs (Upper Memory Blocks) accessed via the XMS API, but the
   management is different: unlike MS Emm386, there's no chain of UMBs, linked
   with a 16-byte header ( somewhat similar to DOS MCBs ). Instead, the UMB
   addresses and sizes are stored in a table in extended memory, not accessible
   by external programs. The table can hold up to 8 blocks.
</LI>
<LI> - MS Emm386 tries to map physical memory in its linear address space, in such
   a way that linear and physical addresses are identical. This isn't done by
   Jemm, because it may consume quite a lot of physical memory for paging
   tables - at least if 4KB pages are used, as it is the case with MS Emm386.
</LI>
<LI> - Both Jemm and MS Emm386 supply the NOVCPI commandline option. However, the
   effects differ: with Jemm, VCPI function DE01h will be deactivated by this
   option, thus refusing to start any VCPI client. In contrast, MS Emm386's
   NOVCPI makes the monitor still offer the full API, but no VCPI memory can
   be allocated.
</LI>
</UL>


 6. Errors and Warnings

 Errors will make Jemm386/JemmEx abort the load process, while warnings
 will be displayed and then the load process continues.

 - "Error: no XMM found, required"
   Jemm386 only. Jemm386 needs an XMM - try Himem(S)X.

 - "Error: XMM already installed"
   JemmEx only. Since JemmEx has its very own XMM, it cannot tolerate
   another one in the system.

 - "Error: DPMI host detected"
   Both Jemm386 and JemmEx refuse to load if a DPMI host has been detected.

 - "Error: No supported A20 method detected"
   JemmEx only. JemmEx is NOT compatible with this system.

 - "Error: enable A20 failed"
   JemmEx only. JemmEx is NOT compatible with this system.

 - "Error: can't get I15 memory status"
   JemmEx only. Int 15h, AX=E820h ( and the fallbacks, Int 15h,
   ax=E801h/ah=88h ) failed or returned an amount of 0 kB extended memory.
   Tool memstat may help to find the problem.

 - "Error: can't get XMS memory status"
   Jemm386 only. The XMS host reports no extended memory. Tool xmsstat
   may give a hint what's wrong.

 - "Error: can't allocate enough I15 memory"
   JemmEx only. Run tool memstat to see how much extended memory the
   system is reporting.

 - "Error: can't allocate enough XMS memory"
   Jemm386 only. Run tool xmsstat to see how much extended memory the
   XMM is reporting.

 - "Error: can't lock XMS memory"
   Jemm386 only. Well, this shouldn't happen. Jemm386 needs the physical
   address of the memory block where it is to reside. The XMM most likely has
   to be replaced.

 - "Warning: option 'xxx=' rejected, invalid syntax"
   The option is ignored.

 - "Warning: E820 - too many ext memory blocks, block xxxxxxxx ignored!"
   JemmEx only. Occurs if int 15h, ax=e820h returns more than 10 available
   memory blocks. It's very well possible that super-extended memory isn't
   available if this warning has occured. The only cure is to adjust constant
   ?XMS_STATICHDLS in file jemm16.inc and recompile JemmEx.

 - "Warning: address of allocated EMB (=XXXXXX) is beyond 16MB" 
   Jemm386 only. Means that Jemm386 is forced to reside beyond the physical
   16MB barrier. No problem for Jemm386 itself, but the VDS API requires a
   DMA buffer that is located below that 16MB barrier. So one is better off not
   to ignore this warning. To fix it: a) ensure that Jemm386 is loaded just
   after the XMM; b) replace the XMM, use HimemX2.exe instead of HimemX.exe
   (if an extended memory block is allocated, HimemX2 tries to return the
   block with the lowest address that satisfies the request).

 - "Warning: no suitable page frame found, EMS functions limited."
   Most programs using EMS won't work without a page frame, so this warning
   should not be ignored. To analyze the problem, a first step may be to load
   Jemm from the command line, with the /V option to see why it cannot find a
   64 kB region to be used as page frame. Possible reasons are:
    - UMBPCI is used. Memory regions activated by UMBPCI are detected by Jemm
      and hence won't be used for mapping the Page Frame.
    - BIOS marks 128 kB ( E0000-FFFFF ) as reserved in Int 15h, ax=E820h.
    Using the video segment A000 as page frame is useful only for very specific
   applications and cannot be recommended. Using regions below A000 are even
   more problematic on machines with 640 kB conventional memory, since the
   address range is already "owned" by DOS. 
    If it's not possible to make Jemm use a valid page frame, it should be setup
   with option NOEMS.

 - "Warning: EMS banking start too low, set to 0x1000."
   This warning only occurs if option B=xxxx has been used inappropriately.

 - "Warning: MIN has been reduced to n kB"
   Warning occurs if the amount given for MIN exceeds available free memory. 

 - "Warning: wanted DMA buffer size too large, set to 128 kB"
   Warning occurs if option D=nnn has been used with a value larger than
   the maximum of 128 (kb).

 - "Warning: XMS host doesn't provide handle array, dynamic memory allocation off!"
   Jemm386 only. Jemm wants the XMM to reveal its handle table. If this feature
   isn't available, Jemm has to allocate its memory for EMS and VCPI statically
   on startup.


 7. Troubleshooting, Hints

 - If Jemm halts or reboots the machine, the following combinations
   of parameters may help to find the reason. Generally, Jemm386 should be
   loaded immediately after the XMM (HIMEM[S]X.EXE, HIMEM.SYS), and the XMM
   itself should be the first device driver to be loaded. For testing, it
   might also help to prevent DOS from loading in the HMA and/or not to
   use UMBs at all.

     This is the safest combination. If this doesn't work, Jemm most
     likely isn't compatible with the current DOS/BIOS; for example,
     the BIOS might try to unconditionally use "unreal" mode to access
     USB mass storage devices - with Jemm, this will cause an exception.

   - X=TEST NOHI NOINVLPG

     This is slightly less safe, since Jemm will scan the upper memory
     region to find "unused" address ranges usable for UMBs. If this
     doesn't work, one has to manually set X=xxxx-yyyy to finally
     find the region which causes the troubles. Tool MEMSTAT may be used
     to find the address region which is reserved for the ROM-BIOS.

 - Jemm can be loaded from the command line with option LOAD. This may be
   helpful if there are so many displays during the boot process that one
   cannot read them carefully. Also, option /V should be added to make
   Jemm talkative. To load Jemm386 from the command line, ensure that a
   XMM has been loaded previously. For JemmEx, no XMM must be loaded, since
   it is included.

 - Jemm has been verified to run on the following virtual environments:

    Qemu, VMware, VirtualPC, Bochs, VirtualBox

   However, it might be necessary to set option NOINVLPG.

 - Some DOS programs will not work if EMS is enabled without a page frame.
   MS CodeView v4.1, for example, may refuse to start then.

 - Some DOS programs will crash if too much VCPI memory is offered. Jemm's
   default is 128MB, it can be changed with option MAX=xxx. Popular
   programs that may cause troubles are programs that use Borland's DPMI hosts
   DPMI16BI.OVL/DPMI32VM.OVL (coupled with RTM.EXE/32RTM.EXE). Setting Jemm
   option MAX=32752K ( that's 32MB minus 16kB) should help; alternately, try
   setting environment variable "DPMIMEM=MAXMEM 16383".

 - The JEMM ;-) DOS Extender (used for "Strike Commander" and "Privateer")
   isn't compatible with the VME option. This requirement is a strong sign
   that this extender switches to V86 mode on its own, which is a bad idea
   for a VCPI client.

 - Unlike MS Emm386, Jemm does not try to identity-map extended memory in its
   address space. This prevents the PL0 debugger 386SWAT from "intruding".

 - If Jemm is installed from the commandline, loading the CTMOUSE driver
   v1.9x and v2.0x might cause an exception. Adding option NOHI or NORAM
   when installing Jemm should avoid that. In CTMOUSE v2.1 the bug has
   been fixed.

 - With some BIOSes disk access speed slows down significantly in V86-mode.
   Most likely this is because the BIOS routines want to avoid using DMA in
   this mode. Loading XDMA32 ( and XCDROM32 ) might fix that.

 - FreeDOS regrettably accepts just one UMB provider. This makes it impossible
   for example to use UMBM.EXE to supply UMB D000-DFFF and then tell Jemm to
   additionally supply B000-B7FF as UMB. MS-DOS has no such problems.

 - Although including the region B000-B7FF might work in most cases, one
   should be aware that this region is not really free, it's used by the
   VGA "monochrome" video modes.

 - To make Jemm behave (almost) like MS Emm386 regarding UMBs one should
   set both options X=TEST and I=TEST. For better MS Emm386 compatibility
   one might also consider to restrict VCPI memory to 32 MB by adding
   option MAX=32M. If NODYN is used, one should also set at least MIN=256K.

 - The NOVCPI option may be used to setup an environment similiar to Windows
   DOS boxes:
   - install Jemm with VCPI enabled
   - install a DPMI host residently (HDPMI, DPMIONE, ...)
   - disable VCPI with the NOVCPI option
   This forces any DOS extended application to either use DPMI or abort.

 - If Jemm displays warning

     System memory found at XXXX-XXXX, region might be in use

   then that region is not used by Jemm. If you are sure that the region
   is ok to be used, include it with 'I=XXXX-XXXX'.

 - The I=XXXX commandline option may be used to include the VGA "graphics"
   segment A000h. It might be possible to increase DOS conventional memory
   up to 736 kB by option I=A000-B7FF. However, there are quite a few
   hurdles that may cause unexpected results:
   - conventional memory is increased only if the region to include is
     adjacent to current memory. On newer machines, there's very often a
     "hole", caused by the Extended BIOS Data Area (XBDA or EBDA); thus
     the included region just becomes an UMB and won't increase lower memory.
     Option MOVEXBDA or tool MOVEXBDA.EXE may fix this issue.
   - Once address space A000h is remapped, any attempts to run programs that
     use VGA graphics most likely will cause a crash.
   - Depending on the VGA-BIOS it may happen that some non-graphics functions
     won't work anymore and may also cause a crash. Not unusual is that the 
     current text font becomes corrupted ( text font bitmaps must be copied 
     from ROM to VGA memory when a video text mode is set ).
   - DOS conventional memory cannot be increased anymore once UMB have been 
     added to the DOS memory pool. So you cannot use tool UMBM here!
   - if MOVEXBDA.EXE causes a system lock during boot, add the /A option to 
     the line in CONFIG.SYS that loads the driver. This aligns the XBDA to 
     a kB boundary, which may cure the lock.
   - the GRUB boot loader may, under certain conditions, allocate a chunk
     of conventional memory BELOW the XBDA. In this case conventional memory
     cannot be increased anymore, even if the XBDA is moved.


 8. Additional Tools

 8.1 UMBM

 UMBM is a small tool only useful in conjunction with Uwe Sieber's UMBPCI.
 The main purpose of UMBM is to allow DOS to load the XMM into upper memory.
 This driver must be loaded before Jemm386 and therefore DOS can't use UMBs 
 provided by Jemm386. For JemmEx, UMBM is usually not needed, since the XMM is 
 included and needs no low memory.

 How does UMBM work? It expects to find a "shadow" RAM region activated by
 UMBPCI. Then it installs inself as a temporary XMS host which just provides
 support for allocating UMBs. This is enough for most DOSes to grab the
 memory (note: for this to work line DOS=UMB is required in CONFIG.SYS). After
 the UMBs have been allocated, UMBM will be removed from memory automatically.

 Additionally, UMBM understands the /XBDA option. This will cause UMBM
 to move the XBDA into its first UMB, thus freeing even more low DOS memory.
 
 UMBs based on "shadow" RAM, as it is supplied by UMBPCI+UMBM, may have
 limitations depending on the motherboard's chipset. Sometimes the memory
 is inaccessible for DMA (read the documentation coming with UMBPCI for more
 details). OTOH, logical and physical addresses for these UMBs are identical,
 which may be an advantage, especially for the XBDA. 

 Enter "UMBM" on the command line and read the example how to add UMBM
 to CONFIG.SYS. UMBM has been tested to run with MS-DOS 6/7 and FreeDOS.


 8.2 JEMFBHLP

 JEMFBHLP is a tiny device driver only needed if both FreeDOS and Jemm's
 FASTBOOT option are used. FreeDOS v1.0 does not provide the information
 that Jemm needs for FASTBOOT to work, so this driver tries to cure FreeDOS'
 incapability. It saves the values for interrupt vectors 15h and 19h at
 0070h:0100h, which is the MS-DOS compatible way to do it.

 In more recent FreeDOS versions this problem has been fixed.


 8.3 CPUSTAT

 CPUSTAT displays some system registers and tables. Most of the registers
 aren't accessible in v86-mode, so - for Jemm - this program may be seen as
 a test if the emulation of privileged opcodes works as expected.

 Optionally, if cpu runs in V86-mode, CPUSTAT may display GDT, IDT, paging
 tables and informations stored in the task state segment of the v86-monitor.
 Run "CPUSTAT -?" for more details.


 8.4 MEMSTAT

 MEMSTAT may be used to display the machine's memory layout, as it is
 returned by the BIOS. The most interesting infos are:

 - address region reserved for the ROM-BIOS
 - total amount of free memory


 8.5 XMSSTAT

 XMSSTAT can be used to display the current status of the installed XMM.
 It allows to check current values of JemmEx options X2MAX, MAXEXT and
 XMSHANDLES.


 8.6 EMSSTAT

 EMSSTAT can be used to display the current status of the installed EMM.
 It works with any EMM, not just Jemm.


 8.7 VCPI

 VCPI may be used to display the VCPI status of the installed EMM.
 With option -p it will display the page table entries for the conventional
 memory.


 8.8 MOVEXBDA

 MOVEXBDA is a device driver supposed to move the Extended BIOS Data
 Area ( XBDA or EBDA ) to low DOS memory. If an XBDA exists, it is usually
 located just below the A000 video segment, with a size of 1-12 kB.

 Some DOS versions will move the XBDA on their own - at least if its size
 doesn't exceed 1 kB; then MOVEXBDA is not needed and will do nothing if 
 launched. Also, both JemmEx and UMBM have the ability to move the XBDA as 
 well; those tools move the XBDA to upper memory, thus increasing low DOS 
 memory. However, sometimes MOVEXBDA may be the best option available -
 because moving the XBDA into an UMB supplied by Jemm (or UMBPCI) may cause
 the system to "lock".

 MOVEXBDA should work with any EMM.


 8.9 CPUID

 CPUID displays cpu features returned by the CPUID instruction.

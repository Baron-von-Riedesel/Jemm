  JDeb386 is a ring 0 debugger for Jemm386/JemmEx. It's actually using DebugRV,
 a variant of the ring0 debugger core DebugR. It can be used to debug any
 program running in the context of a v86-monitor program ( JemmEx/Jemm386),
 in both protected-mode and v86-mode.


 2. Usage
 
  JDeb386 is a JLM and uses JLoad to load itself in the v86-monitor address
 context. Once JDeb386 is loaded and initialized, it will become active when

  - an exception is detected; this includes debug exceptions and breakpoints
  - SysReq ( Alt & Print ) is pressed

  JDeb386 needs at least Jemm v5.83.

  For a description of the debugger commands see Debug.txt.


 3. Features & Restrictions

 - since JDeb386 is a JLM it has no DOS memory footprint. Also, since it
   doesn't modify the IVT, it's very hard for programs to detect it, and even
   harder to protect against it.
   
 - JDeb386 does not handle protected-mode software that runs as VCPI client
   ( DOS extenders ). Those install their very own address context and IDT,
   which JDeb386 doesn't try to access or modify.

 - The Jemm386/JemmEx address context consists mostly of "free" address space;
   if the debugger tries to access memory at such addresses, page faults will
   occur. They are reported, but can be safely ignored.
 
 - JLoad installs a subset of the Win9X ring 0 API, which uses interrupt 20h
   in protected-mode as a sort of dynamic link mechanism. JDeb386 is unaware
   of this API and handles Int 20h like any other software interrupt - that is,
   it might write a breakpoint instruction ( int 3 ) just behind the Int 20h.
   This should cause a GPF, since the Int 20h API expects two words as
   arguments just behind the Int 20h. So if an Int 20h is seen, one has to
   either avoid the T(race) cmd [using G(o)] or set TM 1.

 - I/O handling:
    With cmdline option /C[1-4] one may switch I/O to a serial port.
   If this option isn't used, low-level video and keyboard access are used
   as default. It's possible for JDeb386 to use the mode switching routines
   of the v86-monitor (to call BIOS function INT 10h/16h), but in many cases
   this isn't acceptable for low-level debugging.
    These are the options regarding I/O handling of JDeb386:
   
    "nmake vio=0"       (disables low-level video output; BIOS int 10h used)
    "nmake kbd=0"       (disables low-level keyboard input; BIOS int 16h used)
    "nmake klang=gr"    (low-level keyboard input; GR layout used instead of US)

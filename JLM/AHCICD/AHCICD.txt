
  1. About AHCICD

  AHCICD is a JLM to access AHCI optical disks, "inspired" by Rudolph R. Loew's
  AHCICD.SYS. To load it, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE AHCICD.DLL [options]

  options are:

   /C:device select AHCI controller if more than one exists.
   /D:name   set device name. Required.
   /Q        no displays unless errors occur.


  2. Hints

  AHCI uses tables that may be located in the XBDA - so don't move
  the XBDA if AHCDCD is used.
  AHCICD.DLL needs JLOAD v5.83 - older versions won't disable caching
  of the controller's memory-mapped registers.

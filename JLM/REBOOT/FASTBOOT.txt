   The FastBoot JLM allows some fine-tuning of Jemm's fast reboot behavior
  (which is activated by Jemm's FASTBOOT option). 

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE FASTBOOT.DLL [options]
   
   Valid options are:
   /Dn    : select a HD to boot from (n=0-7; 0 is first HD and default).
            This will work for the DOS variants that are able to boot from
            any HD, without "remapping" them in the BIOS.
   /Pn    : select a partition to boot from (n=1-8; if n > 4, the partition 
            will be searched in the (first) extended partition. If this option
            is omitted, the FastBoot JLM will load & run the MBR's boot code.
   /B:file: select a "boot sector" file to be used for booting. This file is
            expected to have a size of 512 bytes and contain executable boot
            code.

   Additionally, the FastBoot JLM implements an API to load and activate the
  "boot variant" of Debug/X - DebugB. This allows to debug the DOS kernel
  during initialization without modifying the boot sector of the partition.

   Jemm's FASTBOOT option is not guaranteed to work, please read the chapter
  about the requirements in Jemm's documentation.

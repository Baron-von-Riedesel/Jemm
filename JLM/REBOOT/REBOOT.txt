
  1. About ReBoot and FastBoot

  Reboot and FastBoot are JLMs to modify the reboot process.
  
  a) Reboot is just a sample, supposed to be modified if Jemm's default
  way to reboot doesn't work on a certain machine. To load, add the
  following line to CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE REBOOT.DLL

  b) FastBoot comes in 2 variants - FastBoot.dll and FastbDbg.dll. They
  both allow some fine tuning of Jemm's fast reboot (which is activated
  by Jemm's FASTBOOT option): with an optional argument one can select a
  partition to boot from, thus circumventing the MBR boot code.

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE FASTBOOT.DLL [/1 | /2 | /3 | /4]

   FastbDbg.dll will additionally install the DebugB debugger variant. When
  rebooting, a breakpoint is set just before the boot sector code is executed.

   Jemm's FASTBOOT option is not guaranteed to work, please read the chapter
  about the requirements in Jemm's documentation.

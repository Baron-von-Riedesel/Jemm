  JLStub is NOT a JLM. It's a stub, supposed to be added to other binaries.
 Currently it's used by JemmDbg. It's purpose is to avoid having to type
 "jload jemmdbg.dll" - instead, the stub is added to jemmdbg.exe (just a
 renamed jemmdbg.dll). When JemmDbg.exe is launched, the stub takes over,
 searches for jload.exe and runs it, so one can start JemmDbg simply by
 typing "JemmDbg".

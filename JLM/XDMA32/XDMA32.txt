 XDMA32 is a JLM based on Jack R. Ellis' XDMA Ultra-DMA HD driver.
 It supports PCI IDE controllers running in "legacy" or "native" mode.
 To load it, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE XDMA32.DLL [options]

 options are:

  /B   always use XMS buffer for file i/o. Might be useful in virtualized
       environments which can't handle DMA properly for all addresses.
       This switch is more restrictive than /L, and it disables /F.
  /F   "fast", uses DMA "scatter/gather" method to allow transfers
       which cross a physical 64 kB boundary. Might not work with all
       controllers, so use with care! (The "fast" is a historical
       remnant, on modern systems there will be no significant difference
       in speed.)
  /L   limits DMA to "low memory" below 640 kB. Addresses above are 
       handled through the XMS buffer.
  /Mn  set/restrict UDMA mode to n (0 <= n <= 7).
  /P:VVVVDDDD set PCI vendor and device ID for IDE Busmaster controller
       to search for. This option might be useful if the PCI Bios doesn't
       support to find a PCI class code (Int 1Ah, AX=B103h).
  /Q   quiet mode.
  /W   handle (non-UDMA) drives which are capable of Multiword-DMA.


  2. Hints

  - if the driver is used in a Qemu (v0.8x or v0.9) VM, add option
    /P:80867010 to make it find Qemu's IDE controller.

  - xdma32 has no device ID associated with it and hence jload cannot detect
    currently if the driver is already installed.


  3. History

  __.__.2022: v1.5

   - ensure that busmaster flag in PCI command register is set.
   - created .data segment with variables to separate them from code.
 
  08.08.2022: v1.4

   - option /M was implemented in such a way that it became obligatory
     to set it to make the driver work.

  07/26/2011: v1.3

   - to determine the number of HDs in the system, an Int 13h, ah=08
     is issued. BIOS variable 0040:0075 is ignored.

  04/20/2011: v1.2

   - bugfix: HDs attached to the "native" secondary channel were
     ignored.

  12/28/2007: v1.1

   - bugfix: HDs attached to the "legacy" secondary channel didn't
     work (wrong DMA ports).
   - options /B, /M, /W and /P added, /UF option changed to /F.
   - now max. 8 HDs are supported.
   - usage of Jemm's new export 'MoveMemory' reduces interrupt latency,
     and also makes this version incompatible with Jemm v5.68 and below.

  12/03/2007: v1.0

   - initial. Ported from XDMA v3.3. Added support for both "legacy"
     and "native" IDE controllers.

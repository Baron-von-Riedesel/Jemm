
 1. About

 QPIEMU is a JLM that partly emulates the Qemm API (QPI). Its
 purpose is to provide the IO trapping part of QPI, for better support
 of sound card emulation in DOS.


 2. Install/Uninstall QPIEMU

 QPIEMU can be installed either as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE QPIEMU.DLL

 or as a TSR from the command line:

   JLOAD QPIEMU.DLL

 To uninstall, use JLOAD's -u option:

   JLOAD -u QPIEMU.DLL


 3. Using QPIEMU

 Once QPIEMU is installed, tools that use the QPI ( i.e. SBEMU )
 and hence usually require Qemm to be installed, should run with
 Jemm386/JemmEx.

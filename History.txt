
 History

 12.04.2022: v5.81
 - JemmEx: XMS extension v3.51 (super-extended block moves) implemented.

 18.06.2021: v5.80
 - for exceptions other than page faults, the monitor will display register
   CR4 instead of CR2, if it exists.
 - Jemm might have reduced last MCB by 16 byte when loaded while UMBs
   where already available and used by DOS.
 - Jemm does again scan the region C000-EFFF for RAM. This avoids
   a system crash if upper memory has been supplied by UMBPCI and is
   used by DOS.
 - new option MOVEXBDA for Jemm implemented.
 - JemmEx will recognize memory blocks activated by UMBPCI and include them
   into its UMB pool. Makes option S=start-end virtually obsolete.
 - a warning is displayed if the extended memory block where Jemm386 will
   reside is beyond the 16MB limit.
 - strategy to realloc an EMB to increase its size has been changed and is
   now smart enough to check if the block can be increased without moving
   it.
 - UMBM no longer requires the /I parameter; it will scan for blocks with
   the UMBPCI signature.
 - UMBM has new option /XBDA.
 - UMBM now acts gracefully if line DOS=UMB is missing in CONFIG.SYS.
 - MOVEXBDA has got option /A to make it align the new XBDA to a kB boundary.
 - tool CPUSTAT split into CPUSTAT and CPUID.
 - emulation of Int 15h, ah=87 (move extended memory) has been enhanced
   to allow to access physical memory beyond the 4 GB border via PSE-36.
 - JemmEx XMM now implements XMS v3.5 (extended memory > 4 GB). Default XMS
   handles changed to 48 (previously 32). Added MAXSEXT option for JemmEx,
   and also added JemmExL.exe, that still supports XMS v3.0 only.
 - JemmEx: return DX=0 if XMS alloc functions fail (XMS spec).
 - option I=TEST does now indeed what's documented. Previously it only
   scanned regions of "external" ROMs ( i.e., the ROM of the VGA card ).
   This means it's more "aggressive" now.
 - ALTBOOT option sends "system reset" command to keyboard controller.

 02/02/2020: v5.79
 - if physical address of DMA buffer was beyond 16M, its size was reset
   to zero. This is no longer done.
 - default linker is now JWlink.
 - debug displays added for mode switch calls.
 - Jemm will now use info returned by Int 15h, ax=E820h to mark regions
   in the upper memory area as reserved. If the call was successful,
   Jemm won't scan the memory region C000-EFFF for RAM.
 - VME (virtual mode extensions) is now off by default; there exist CPUs
   that claim to support VME but actually don't.
 - JemmEx's built-in XMS host will now use up to 8 memory blocks listed
   by ACPI (int 0x15, ax=0xe820). Previously it could just use the one
   with base address 0x100000. 
 - fixed: shrinking an EMB didn't work correctly.

 07/15/2012: v5.78

 - bugfix: if SPLIT option was set and there were 2 ROMs to be split on
   adjacent 4K-pages, the latter one may have been overwritten with zeros
   (problem found in Qemu v0.15.1).
 - bugfix: MOVEXBDA didn't restore the XBDA at reboot. This may have been
   a problem if the FASTBOOT option was active.
 - a warning is displayed if the page frame isn't set to a segment address
   divisible by 0x400 without remainder ( i.e, FRAME=DF00 will trigger the
   warning ).
 - MEMSTAT additionally displays location and size of XBDA.
 - source package only: extrsect.exe replaced by bin2inc.exe; bin2inc.exe
   is needed only if Masm is used to assemble the source.

 06/20/2012: v5.77

 - commandline option I=A000-B7FF didn't increase DOS low memory, the
   region became just the first UMB.
 - tool MOVEXBDA added.

 05/25/2012: v5.76

 - an 64kB EMS page frame may now be located inside address space included
   with 'I=XXXX'.

 05/21/2012: v5.75a

 - no changes in JemmEx/Jemm386, just bugfixes in XDMA32.DLL and 
   XCDROM32.DLL.

 05/31/2011: v5.75

 - bugfix: when Jemm detected Ctrl-Alt-Del, it didn't reset the keyboard
   status. This may have caused a locked keyboard if FASTBOOT was set.

 04/14/2011: v5.74

 - tool MEMSTAT added, which will display the size of the reserved 
   BIOS-ROM region.
 - Make process simplified, all sources are assembly now.

 12/02/2010: v5.73

 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=51h didn't complain if handle was invalid in 
   v5.61-5.72.
 - tool CPUSTAT added.
 - for emulation of Int 15h, AH=87h (extended memory block move), the
   region 100000h-10FFFFh is now handled similar to the rest of extended
   memory. Previously it was handled as "real-mode" memory, which means
   that access did depend on the A20 state. This new behavior matches
   more closely the BIOS implementation of this interrupt.
 - option V86EXC0D added.

 03/13/2008: v5.72

 - source has been made compatible with JWasm; OTOH, TASM compatibility
   has been abandoned.

 02/25/2008: v5.71

 - bugfix: DMA buffer size of 0 (D=0) didn't work in v5.70.
 - bugfix: JLOAD v5.70 made wrong assumptions about Jemm's TSS location,
   which caused JLM sample JCLOCK2 to fail.
 - some minor changes to make it compatible with JWasm.
 
 01/30/2008: v5.70

 - bugfix: the "copy memory" routine wasn't reentrant, making an XMS
   "block move" or a call of Int 15h, ah=87h from within an ISR slightly
   unsafe.
 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=57h returned error 8Ah instead of 93h when a 
   region exceeded the size of the EMS handle.
 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=57h accepted any region type (just 00 and 01 are
   valid ones).
 - bugfix: int 67h, ax=5701h accepted overlapping EMS regions. Now status
   97h is returned.
 - bugfix: since v5.61 (support for mappable pages in conventional memory)
   option NODYN often failed to make all memory available which was 
   requested with the MIN=x option.
 - bugfix: exception 11h in v86-mode caused a loop in Jemm's exception
   handler.
 - bugfix: due to an alignment problem the low byte of max. free memory
   block for XMS v2 (X2MIN) was 0, as a result the default block size was
   65280 (0xFF00) instead of 65535 kB (JemmEx only, bug since v5.64).
 - int 67h,ax=5701h, "memory exchange" is now also done with interrupts
   enabled if client's interrupt flag is set.
 - port 60h access is now trapped only if the keyboard controller's output
   port is accessed.
 - tool XMSSTAT and source of EMSSTAT added.

 01/07/2008: v5.69

 - descriptions/changelogs for XDMA32 and XCDROM32 extracted from this
   readme into separate files XDMA32.TXT and XCDROM32.TXT.
 - memory block copies are now done with interrupts enabled - if client's
   interrupt flag is set. This avoids interrupt latency and makes the
   previously implemented "interrupt windows" obsolete. It also avoids
   problems with Jemm's HLT emulation causing IRQs to be misinterpreted
   as exceptions (08, 09, 74, ...) on some cpus.
 - bugfix: VDS scatter/gather lock with region size 0 returned 0 entries,
   but 1 entry must be returned in any case (MS Emm386 does as well).
 - bugfix: there was a risk that a ROM located contiguously behind another
   ROM in address space wasn't detected.
 - bugfix: if SPLIT option was set and a split ROM page followed an UMB
   page (which is possible if ROM size is < 4 kB), the ROM part of this
   page was added to the UMB.
 - bugfix: synchronization of VCPI and EMS free memory count did work
   for VCPI only, that is, allocating all VCPI memory didn't reduce free
   EMS memory to zero.
 - bugfix: the last XMS memory block allocated for EMS/VCPI memory was
   likely to be too large, thus wasting XMS memory.
 - VCPI/EMS memory alloc/release speed-up.
 - EMSSTAT -v displays more VCPI infos.
 - v86 exceptions >= 8 are routed to v86 interrupt 06h only if this vector
   has been changed by another program.
 - exception 10h (floating point) is now detected and displayed, thus avoiding
   the hazardous call of video interrupt 10h (MS Emm386 also detects
   exception 10h, but just allows to reboot then).

 12/03/2007: v5.68

 - bugfix: JLOAD's "Lock DMA" function ignored flag to check for 64 kB
   border crossing.
 - NMIs occuring inside the monitor are now silently routed to v86-mode.
   Previous Jemm versions displayed an exception dump.
 - XDMA32 v1.0 added.
 - XCDROM32 changed to v1.1.

 10/13/2007: v5.67

 - bugfix: I=TEST always scanned 4 kB chunks, although the last page
   of a ROM might be smaller (512, 1024, ... bytes).
 - bugfix: if I=TEST found an "unused" page in a ROM, v5.64-5.66 messed
   up an internal counter. As a result, there was a small risk that the
   begin of another ROM following this one in the address space wasn't
   detected.
 - error code displayed in exception dump.
 - selected A20 method now displayed in "verbose" mode only.
 - tool EMSSTAT added.

 08/24/2007: v5.66

 - bugfix: GDT, which has been moved to nonshared space in v5.6, moved
   to shared space again. Required by applications written for the Phar
   Lab TNT DOS extender.

 08/19/2007: v5.65

 - Standard reboot handler made fully MS Emm386 compatible. The ALTBOOT
   option is now a dummy.
 - auto-scanning for a page frame will now ensure that the frame begins
   on a 16 kB boundary. This is MS Emm386 compatible.

 07/12/2007: v5.64

 - bugfix: for FASTBOOT, IVT vectors 78h-7Fh should be reset to 0000:0000.
   This wasn't done.
 - SPLIT option added.

 06/22/2007: v5.63

 - bugfix: NOEMS didn't disable EMS in v5.62
 - bugfix [JemmEx only]: MAXEXT option wasn't displayed in help screen.

 06/19/2007: v5.62

 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=5301h (set handle name) didn't check if this name
   was already assigned (and return status A1h if yes).
 - bugfix: using I=TEST might have reduced amount of UMBs by 4 kB.
 - bugfix: in v5.61, Int 67h, ax=5900h still returned 8 as mapping context
   size, which usually is too small now (# of physical pages are > 4).
 - bugfix: in v5.61, if Jemm was loaded from the command line and 
   remained in low memory, it didn't hook into the driver chain.
 - bugfix: in v5.61, there was a risk that Jemm386 didn't install an
   UMB handler (and then the UMBs were "lost").
 - int 67h, ah=5Bh implemented (alternate map register sets).
 - the EMS system handle is now populated with the mappable pages below
   A000h, as described in EMS 4.0 docs (and also done by MS Emm386).

 06/04/2007: v5.61

 - bugfix: Int 67h, ah=51h (EMS reallocate) might have failed to increase
   the handle's pages although there were enough free pages available.
   This was a design flaw. Now for each EMS handle a linked lists of
   allocated pages is maintained.
 - bugfix: trying to release the NULL handle will now reallocate it with
   size 0. This is the behavior specified in the EMS docs.
 - bugfix: there was a chance that 4 VCPI pages got lost. They could be
   allocated, but weren't found anymore when trying to release them.
 - bugfix: memory for UMBs is no longer contained in EMS system handle 0.
   This handle should only contain pages which "backfill" conventional
   memory (segment addresses below A000h).
 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=56h (alter page map and call) ignored the "old"
   member in the "map_and_call" parameter.
 - value of GDTR, IDTR and TR exposed by Jemm. This allows JLoad to avoid
   usage of opcodes SGDT/SIDT, which caused problems with most virtualizers.
 - allocating a 4kB page with VCPI is now significantly faster.
 - B=xxxx parameter supported. Pages 4000-9FFF are mappable by default.

 05/24/2007: v5.6

 - bugfix: if Jemm had to emulate an IRET in v86-mode and the copy of the
   flag register onto the stack was "invalid" (IOPL != 3), a GPF occured
   at the next IO-sensitive instruction in v86-mode.
 - bugfix [JemmEx only]: NODYN option caused a GPF on initialization.
 - dword and string I/O now simulated correctly for trapped port access.
 - GDT and IDT moved to nonshared memory.
 - the ring 0 stack has been increased to 4 kB and moved to nonshared space.
   This allows "nested execution" without using the client's v86-stack.
 - JLOAD.EXE added. Jemm splitted in 2 packages: binaries and source.
   Some sample JLMs added (XCDROM32, KEYBGR, ...).
 - new EMMXXXX0 function exposes some of Jemm's internal call tables,
   thus allowing external modules (JLOAD) to implement a 32bit ring 0 API.
 - switched to a table-oriented IO-port trapping implementation, which
   allows external modules (JLOAD) to hook/take over port trapping.

 05/04/2007: v5.52

 - bugfix: a bug introduced in v5.5 caused garbage to be displayed if
   option I=B000-B7FF was used.

 05/03/2007: v5.51

 - bugfix [JemmEx only]: XMS memory realloc function (ah=0Fh) caused the
   stack not to be dword-aligned, which slows things down and might cause
   troubles if an interrupt occurs during a memory block move.
 - JemmEx: EMS block moves (int 67h, ah=57h) now also done with interrupt
   window if client's IF is set.

 04/29/2007: v5.5

 - bugfix: if Ctrl-Alt-Del was pressed with FASTBOOT active and an event
   proc for the PS/2 mouse was set, a crash might have occured. Now the
   PS/2 mouse is reset by Jemm before rebooting.
 - bugfix: S=XXXX was ignored if it was the only region to be added as UMBs.
 - in v5.46, FASTBOOT only worked by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del. Now
   it should work as well if int 19h is called.
 - in v5.46, FASTBOOT always needed ALTBOOT to be set and therefore has set
   this option internally. This is no longer done.
 - JEMMEX.EXE added.
 - JemmEx opens interrupt window in block moves (int 15h, ah=87h and
   XMS function ah=0Bh) each 8 kB if client's IF is set.

 03/27/2007: v5.46

 - bugfix: free EMS pages not always reported correctly.
 - bugfix: translation DMA for 16-bit controller (channels 4-7) didn't work.
 - bugfix: Jemm always displayed "can't continue, please reboot" on
   invalid opcode exceptions in v5.45.
 - MIN= no longer restricted to a maximum of 512 MB (EMS pages still are).
 - FASTBOOT option implemented, JEMFBHLP.EXE added.

 03/02/2007: v5.45

 - bugfix: in v5.40, if no option was entered when installing Jemm, it
   might have displayed some garbage.
 - bugfix: invalid opcode generated by Jemm if running on a cpu < 80386.
 - bugfix: XMS function 11h (free UMB) always returned an error.
 - option UNLOAD added.
 - option RAM/NORAM implemented.
 - valid range for page frame set with FRAME=xxxx now 8000-E000.
 - the MAX= prefix can be omitted now. Makes the cmdline more MS Emm386
   compatible.
 - memory required for UMBs will no longer reduce the memory available for
   EMS. This is similiar to what MS Emm386 does.
 - installing Jemm from the command line now prohibited if a DPMI host
   is detected.

 02/20/2007: v5.4

 - some minor bugfixes.
 - Jemm now moves its resident part to the first UMB which it supplies.
 - NOHI option implemented.
 - Jemm now uses the true (=zero-based) flat memory model.

 01/11/2007: v5.34

 - bugfix: Jemm always hooked int 15h, ah=4Fh, thus always acting as
   if option ALTBOOT was set (bug introduced in v5.25).

 01/06/2007: v5.33

 - bugfix: Jemm erroneously might have disabled EMS
 - reboot code slightly changed, there were still some machines (old 80486?)
   were Ctrl-Alt-Del didn't work.

 11/13/2006: v5.32

 - removed an optimisation which PKZIP didn't like.

 11/09/2006: v5.31

 - some minor bugfixes in function int 67h, ah=57h.
 - bugfix: wrong register contents were displayed in v5.30 for exceptions
   occuring in protected-mode.
 - v86-mode int 06 handler moved to protected-mode, thus further reducing
   Jemm's conventional memory usage.

 10/27/2006: v5.30

 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=57h (move/exchange memory region) didn't always
   invalidate the TLB cache for the EMS memory to copy/exchange.
 - bugfix: int 67h, ax=4F01h didn't work.
 - int 67h, ah=55h/56h implemented.
 - int 67h, ah=57h now works with overlapping memory regions. Furthermore
   it is now ensured that all EMS pages involved in the copy operation are
   valid before copy actually begins.

 10/24/2006: v5.29

 - bugfix: the error msg when the EMS call to map UMBs failed contained
   garbage as "function".
 - int 67h, AH=58h will now return success even with NOEMS.
 - now error code 80h, not 91h is returned if functions int 67h,
   ah=41h or 47h or 48h are called and no page frame is defined.
 - NOINVLPG option added.
 - I=TEST is now a bit less restrictive and will increase compatibility
   with MS-Emm386.
 - help text displayed by Jemm adjusted where it was wrong or unclear.

 10/13/2006: v5.28

 - bugfix, VDS function scatter/gather lock (int 4Bh, ax=8105h): if lower
   12 bits of offset in EDDS were <> 000h, this function always returned 
   the first page as a separate region.
 - bugfix, VDS function scatter/gather lock: if this function failed with
   AL=9, it did not always set the correct value for items required to
   describe the full region.
 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=53h (get/set handle name) and ah=54h (get handle
   directory) wrongly assumed that they won't be called with handles other
   than 0000 if NOEMS is set.
 - bugfix: int 67h, ah=57h (move/exchange memory region) didn't work without
   a page frame (NOEMS or FRAME=NONE).

 10/07/2006: v5.27

 - bugfix: allocating a EMS block with zero pages (int 67h, ah=5Ah, bx=0)
   returned with AH=0, but did not return a valid handle in DX.
 - bugfix: calling int 67h, AH=51h modified AL register.

 09/30/2006: v5.26

 - bugfix: VDS functions 03, 04, 07 and 08 may have failed if bit 1 of DX
   was set (request to copy in/out of DMA buffer) and registers BX,CX
   were <> 0.
 - bugfix: 1 kB of DMA buffer may have been inaccessible.
 - bugfix: releasing a DMA buffer with size > 0 and < 1 kB always failed.

 09/22/2006: v5.25

 - bugfix: if option ALTBOOT is set and Ctrl-Alt-Del being pressed has
   been detected, then the real-mode int 15h chain is called first before
   rebooting. This gives other hookers (SmartDrv) a chance to cleanup.

 09/19/2006: v5.24

 - bugfix: int 67h, ax=5001h (implemented in v5.2) didn't work.
 - bugfix: setting Jemm options from the command line did reset
   the options which were not explicitely entered.
 - PGE/NOPGE options added.

 09/14/2006: v5.23

 - bugfix: if the amount of preallocated EMS memory (MIN=xxxx) was
   not below largest XMS memory block - 384 kB, the amount of free/
   available EMS pages reported by Jemm was up to 384 kB too large.
 - implemented VDS function 05 (scatter lock) returning PTEs instead of
   "regions". This makes Jemm fully support the VDS API.
 - some message texts adjusted to make it clear what is an error, a
   warning or just informational.
 - warning about detected system memory region now displays all such
   regions, start and size.
 - if wanted EMS memory has to be reduced, a warning is displayed.
 - UMBM.EXE added.
 - EMX option added.

 09/09/2006: v5.22 

 - bugfix: the DMA buffer 64kb alignment may cause up to 32 kB to be lost
   for EMS/VCPI memory. This wasn't taken into account, and may have
   resulted in Jemm unable to alloc UMBs if options NODYN and
   MIN=<value below size of UMBs+32> were set.
 - bugfix: in displayed text "wanted preallocated EMS memory <nnn> kB"
   <nnn> was always blank.
 - space for UMBs now rounded up to next 16 kB boundary (previously it
   was rounded to 32 kB).

 09/07/2006: v5.21 

 - bugfix: in v5.2 if an invalid command line parameter was entered, the
   program displayed garbage.
 - bugfix: in v5.2 options setting both options NOEMS and NOVCPI might
   have caused Jemm to run out of memory for UMBs.
 - XMS dynamic memory allocation was automatically disabled if NOEMS and
   NOVCPI options were set, but this is no longer useful since option NODYN
   exists and VCPI can be dynamically set/reset from the command line.
 - DMA buffer size now always rounded up to a full 4 kB boundary.
 - LOAD option added which allows to install Jemm from the command line.

 09/06/2006: v5.2 

 - bugfix: writing to "ROM" page FF000 if ALTBOOT wasn't set caused a crash.
 - bugfix: if XMS handle array was in HMA and A20 got disabled results may
   have been "unexpected".
 - bugfix: "disable A20 local" emulation did not return an error code if
   count was already 0.
 - there was slightly more XMS memory allocated than required.
 - support for Int 67h, ax=5001h implemented.
 - option MIN= no longer deactivates XMS dynamic memory allocation.
   option NODYN added, option EMM= discarded.
 - If XMS memory must be preallocated (because XMS host doesn't export its
   handle table) and MIN= option is not set, Jemm allocates half of
   extended memory (but not more than 32 MB) for EMS/VCPI memory.
 - Assembler: MASM may be used instead of TASM.
 - Compiler: Open Watcom WCC or MS VC 1.5 may be used instead of TC.
 - Linker: Digital Mars OPTLINK may be used instead of TLINK.
 - protected-mode code switched to 32-bit.
 - port trapping added to the A20 enable/disable emulation. XMS hook is
   still required due to the "A20 always on" case, which causes most XMS
   hosts not to touch the ports at all.

 08/30/2006: v5.1

 - bugfix: the DMA master mask register was read, which doesn't work
   on all machines and may have caused an "illegal instruction exception"
   if the floppy disk was accessed. This bug was introduced in v5.00.
 - bugfix in EMS function 4Eh.
 - bugfix: A20 emulation works now if no UMB handler has been installed.
 - DMA buffer size may be set by commandline option. 
 - VDS functions 07/08 (request/release DMA buffer) and 09/0A (copy
   into/out of DMA buffer) implemented. VDS functions 03/04 (lock/unlock
   region) extended so that they call functions 07/08 if needed.
 - NOVCPI does no longer require NOEMS.
 - ALTBOOT (re)implemented, it hooks int 15h, ah=4Fh now.
 - VME mode may now be set/reset with VME/NOVME options. 
 - LIBM.LIB no longer needed to create the JEMM386.EXE binary.

 08/25/2006: v5.01

 - bugfix: "A20 enabled"-count was 0 on startup, should have been 1.
 - bugfix: unsupported VDS functions caused a debug display, which didn't
   work and may have caused corruption of monitor data. Debug displays
   removed.
 - bugfix: original int 4Bh vector may have been 0000:0000 - if this is
   true, it must never be chained to of course. Instead carry flag is set.
 - VDS functions 0Bh and 0Ch (disable/enable translation) implemented.

 08/23/2006: v5.00

 - EMMXXXX0 device communication implemented
 - bugfix: DMA buffer is ensured to begin on a 64 kB physical address
   boundary.
 - bugfix: XMS handles which are no longer used now get the "in pool" flag
   set, not the "free" flag.
 - Pentium+ VME extensions supported. 
 - A20 disable emulation activated.

 08/17/2006: v5.00pre 

 - bugfix: in VCPI protected mode entry switch to host stack before
   context is switched.
 - command line option S=xxxx added.
 - option NOALTBOOT deleted.
 - the full physical memory is no longer mapped in the address space.
   This reduces extended memory usage a lot on machines with large amounts
   or RAM, since no page tables are needed.
 - VDS code moved to extended memory, reducing conventional memory usage
   by about 1 kB.

  c't/Harald Albrecht: created the v86 monitor part and EMS functions
  1990

  tom ehlert: implemented UMB support,
  2001-2004   reboot hooks (keyboard ctrl-alt-del, BIOS FFFF:0000)
              int 15h ext memory copy,
              VDS lock function,
              introduced english comments.

  michael devore: implemented support for VCPI, VDS (partially), dynamic
  2004-2006           XMS memory allocation, EMS v4.0 (partially)
  - Modified for >64M and VCPI support
  - Updated for EMS 4.0, some extended API returns unsupported, this will
    change as requested or needed by other software requirements
  - Documented EMS 4.0 only supports up to 32M (0x800 pages), but some EMS
    drivers allow more than 32M.      The EMS 4.0 spec could be extended to 1G-32K
    (map value of 0xFFFF means unmap) without breaking the spec API,
    but unfortunately breaking unsophisticated programs which get confused.
    I have arbitrarily decided to allow up to 32M of EMS allocations,
    leaving the high bit of page allocation alone since specific drivers
    may make use of high bit values other than 0xFFFF for their own purposes,
    or may only check high bit for unmap -- as FreeDOS EMM386 does.
